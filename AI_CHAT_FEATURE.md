# AI Chat Feature Documentation

## Overview

The AI Chat feature has been successfully added to the Gudang Mitra inventory management system. This feature allows users to interact with an AI assistant that can help them find information about items in the inventory, check availability, compare products, and answer questions about stock levels.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI Assistant
- **Intelligent Responses**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide helpful and contextual responses
- **Inventory Context**: The AI has access to real-time inventory data including item names, descriptions, categories, quantities, and stock status
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can ask questions in natural language about items and inventory

### ðŸ’¬ Chat Interface
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive chat interface with message history
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback while AI processes responses
- **Quick Actions**: Pre-defined quick action buttons for common queries
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### ðŸŽ¯ Multiple Access Points
- **Floating Chat Button**: Always accessible floating button on all pages
- **Dedicated Chat Page**: Full-featured chat page at `/chat` route
- **Navigation Integration**: Chat link in the main navigation menu

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- `ChatInterface.tsx` - Main chat component with message history
- `ChatMessage.tsx` - Individual message component with user/assistant styling
- `ChatInput.tsx` - Input field with quick action buttons
- `ChatButton.tsx` - Floating chat button with responsive modal
- `ChatPage.tsx` - Dedicated full-page chat interface

### Backend API
- `POST /api/chat` - Send message and receive AI response
- `GET /api/chat/items-context` - Get current inventory context
- Session management endpoints (placeholder for future implementation)

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI API**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo model for generating responses
- **Context Injection**: Real-time inventory data is injected into AI prompts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and rate limits

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
Add your OpenAI API key to the server's `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
The OpenAI package has already been installed in the server:
```bash
cd server
npm install openai
```

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
# Start the backend server
cd server
npm start

# Start the frontend (in a new terminal)
npm run dev
```

## Usage Examples

Users can ask questions like:
- "What items are currently in stock?"
- "Show me items that are running low"
- "What electronics do you have?"
- "Help me find office supplies"
- "Is there a laptop available?"
- "What's the status of item X?"

## AI Assistant Capabilities

The AI assistant can help with:
- **Inventory Queries**: Find specific items or categories
- **Stock Status**: Check availability and stock levels
- **Product Information**: Get details about items including descriptions and prices
- **Recommendations**: Suggest alternatives when items are out of stock
- **Comparisons**: Compare different items or categories

## Security & Privacy

- **API Key Security**: OpenAI API key is stored securely in environment variables
- **User Authentication**: Chat feature requires user login
- **Data Privacy**: No personal data is sent to OpenAI, only inventory information

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Persistent Chat Sessions**: Store chat history in database
- **Advanced Context**: Include user request history in AI context
- **File Attachments**: Allow users to upload images or documents
- **Voice Chat**: Add voice input/output capabilities
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages
- **Analytics**: Track common queries and improve responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AI service temporarily unavailable"**
   - Check if OpenAI API key is configured correctly
   - Verify API key has sufficient quota
   - Check internet connectivity

2. **Chat button not appearing**
   - Ensure user is logged in (chat requires authentication)
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. **Slow responses**
   - Normal for AI processing, typically 2-5 seconds
   - Check OpenAI API status if consistently slow

### Error Messages
- **"Message is required"**: User tried to send empty message
- **"Failed to process chat message"**: General server error
- **"AI service temporarily unavailable"**: OpenAI API quota exceeded
